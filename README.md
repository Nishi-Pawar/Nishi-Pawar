## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of Akron with a passion for data science and machine learning. I enjoy exploring how data and technology can be used to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful impact.  
Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Research Assistant, building a computer visionâ€“based anomaly detection system for local manufacturing companies in Akron to help improve product quality and efficiency.  
Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst, where I gained hands-on experience in data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and database management using tools like SQL, Python, and Tableau.  
I love working on projects that involve:
Machine Learning & Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Data Analytics & Visualization (Python, Pandas, Tableau, Power BI)
Computer Vision & Predictive Modeling
BigQuery and SQL for large-scale data handling  
Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies, experiment with data-driven solutions, and collaborate on open-source or research projects that make an impact.
