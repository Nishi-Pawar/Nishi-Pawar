## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nishi Pawar. I am a Computer Science student at the University of Akron with a strong interest in data science and machine learning. I enjoy exploring how data can be used to solve real-world problems, uncover patterns, and create meaningful impact.

Currently, I work as a Research Assistant, where Iâ€™m building a computer visionâ€“based anomaly detection system for local manufacturing companies in Akron to improve product quality and efficiency. Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst, where I developed dashboards, performed exploratory data analysis, and managed databases to support data-driven business decisions.

My technical skills include Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Iâ€™m especially passionate about machine learning, computer vision, and data visualization, and I love turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate on innovative projects, learn from others in the data community, and apply my skills to solve practical challenges through analytics and technology.
